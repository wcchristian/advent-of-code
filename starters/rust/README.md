# Rust Starter

For rust, make sure you have Cargo.toml in your root as we have in the root of this repository. Then each year, add a module to the workspace for your year.

Then every day run the following command in the year folder

`cargo new day05rs`

This will create a brand new space for you to write your code.

Then feel free to copy the other files in this directory for some basic file reader stuff and example and input files.


> Note, there is probably a better way to do this, I'll likely update these instructions when I learn a bit more about rust.
